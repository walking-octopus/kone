### About the project

Thank you for choosing to play Kone! My goal with this 2-minute game was to create a puzzle platformer with my twist. I was inspired by [That Level Again 3](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iamtagir.thatlevelagain3) level where you had to control both players at once.

I would appreciate hearing your thoughts and feedback in the comments below! It's only my 2nd finished game, so I still may be getting something wrong. If you feel that something's wrong or could be improved, write it down in the comments.
